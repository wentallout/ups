# USP

## What is an USP

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device that allows a computer to keep running for at least a short time when incoming power is interrupted. As long as utility power is flowing, it also replenishes and maintains the energy storage. The more energy stored, the longer power can be maintained, with practical limitations that will be discussed later. The differences among UPS systems lies in the technology that enables them to do their jobs.

Energy can be stored in different ways. Rechargeable batteries are the most common. For simplicity the examples and illustrations in this article will be based on that technology. However, kinetic energy can also be stored in heavy, rotating flywheels or energy can be stored as fuel.

## TLDR

Buy a UPS if you want to protect your PC against loss of data due to brownouts / power outages.

Buy a surge protector if you want to protect your PC against power surges. However be aware that most Philippine homes do not have the proper ground wiring for a surge protector to be effective.

Buy a servo AVR if you want to protect your PC against unstable voltage.

In most cases using a surge protector + servo AVR combo is effective in reducing the damage to your PC from power surges and unstable voltage. This is what I usually recommend.

A good quality UPS will often have built-in surge protection and voltage regulation so it might make sense to buy a high quality UPS as an all-in-one device to protect your PC. However such a UPS can be very expensive and battery maintenance is an added long term cost.

If you want to invest in a UPS for your PC, I recommend getting one with "true sine wave output" or "pure sine wave output".

Most PSU's are incompatible with UPS that only produce "square wave" or "stepped approximation of a sine wave" output. Those UPS are actually more harmful and can damage your PSU when switching to battery power.
